          # We should not hard code the key, we must use a dynamic element
          # that's why we will use the hashFiles() function provided by GitHub and pass a path to it
          # the hash value will change whenever the file we pas to it changes, so the contents of the file change
          # the code below will collect all package-lock.json files and builds a hash on the combination of all these files

          # the hash that will be produced by hash files will not be the same as before
          # and therefore we end up with a different hash key indicating to GitHub Actions and this cache action
